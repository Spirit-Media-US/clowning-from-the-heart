# Clowning from the Heart

> **CLAUDE.md belongs in version control — NEVER add it to .gitignore. This file is the shared source of truth for all developers and all Claude Code sessions.**

This site: Clowning from the Heart | Repo: github.com/Spirit-Media-US/clowning-from-the-heart | Domain: clowningfromtheheart.com | Sanity ID: zvhqn0sn

**Migration protocol:** /home/deploy/bin/tools-api/pipelines/migration/CLAUDE.md
**Sanity Studio:** Embedded at clowningfromtheheart.com/studio/ (static build)
**Infrastructure:** Deploy webhook wired, CORS origins configured, studio deployed

## Dev Commands

- `bun run dev` — local preview at localhost:4328
- `bun run build` — production build to dist/

## Mandatory — Before Starting Work
Always start Claude sessions from inside this directory:
```
cd /srv/sites/clowning-from-the-heart && claude
```
Running Claude from ~/ or ~/Sites/ bypasses this project's CLAUDE.md. A pre-edit hook enforces this, but following the workflow prevents warnings and ensures all project rules are loaded.

Then run: `git checkout dev && git pull origin dev`

## Stack

- Astro 5 + Tailwind CSS v4
- Sanity Studio scaffolded in `studio/`
- GA4 analytics integrated
- Amazon click tracking added
- Bing Webmaster Tools verified
- Google Search Console verified
- GHL forms — placeholder only, not yet wired

## Status — as of 2026-04-19

### Completed & Live on Main
- Full site built and deployed to clowningfromtheheart.com
- Responsive hero with watercolor background (sm/md/lg breakpoints)
- Amazon purchase button in hero
- Deployment report committed (deployment-report.html)
- Sanity Studio embedded at /studio with deploy webhook and CORS configured

### On dev (awaiting Kevin merge → main)
- **100 Club wave 2 (2026-04-19):** Beasties (`@playform/inline`) wired + `inlineStylesheets: 'auto'`
  - `@font-face` moved out of `<style is:global>` into `src/styles/global.css` (Tailwind v4 compliant, per performance-gate.md)
  - Both Bebas Neue + Abril Fatface preloaded (both above-fold)
  - Mobile 98→99, Desktop 100 on dev preview (SEO 69 is CF Pages `x-robots-tag: noindex` on `.pages.dev` — production is 100)
- **Fonts (2026-04-18):** Self-hosted from R2 (`ff3e196`)
- **GA lazy-loaded (2026-04-18):** Deferred on first interaction or +6s fallback
- GA4 analytics integrated
- Amazon click tracking added
- Bing Webmaster Tools verified
- Google Search Console verified

### Still Pending
- GHL contact form — not yet wired
- Sanity content population

## Rules

- All work goes to the **dev** branch — never push directly to main
- Only merge dev to main when Kevin says "push to main"
- Never push without local preview first

## Stitch MCP — AI Design Tool

Google Stitch 2.0 is an MCP server available in this project for AI-powered design work. It generates full page designs and auto-creates design systems (colors, typography, component rules). The MCP config is already symlinked into this repo (`.mcp.json`).

**When to use:** When Kevin asks for design work, new page layouts, or visual redesigns. Use Stitch first to get 80–90% of the design done visually, then implement in Astro/Tailwind.

**Available tools (prefixed `mcp__stitch__`):**
`create_project`, `generate_screen_from_text`, `create_design_system`, `apply_design_system`, `edit_screens`, `generate_variants`, `list_projects`, `list_screens`, `get_screen`, `get_project`, `list_design_systems`, `update_design_system`

**Workflow:**
1. Screenshot or paste URL into Stitch as style reference
2. Stitch generates full design + auto-creates design system
3. Export design.md / design system from Stitch
4. Hand off to Claude Code for Astro/Tailwind implementation

**Rules:**
- Use Gemini 3.1 Pro in Stitch (not 3.0 Flash)
- Stitch auto-generates a `design.md` — keep it in the project root for consistency
- This is the standard SMP workflow for all new site builds and major redesigns

100 Club commitments template — copy this block verbatim into a site's CLAUDE.md
during Phase 2H of the execute plan. Substitute clowning-from-the-heart with the actual R2 path slug.
The guardrails script (/home/deploy/bin/100club-lint.sh) self-skips any site whose
CLAUDE.md lacks the heading "## 100 Club commitments", so installing this block
activates the pre-commit lint on the site.

## 100 Club commitments (locked — do not regress)

**100 Club bar (all pages, current and future — anything less is not acceptable):**
- **Homepage**: desktop 100/100/100/100, mobile 100/100/100 + Perf ≥ 95 (flagship, median-of-5)
- **Every other page**: mobile ≥ 90, desktop ≥ 95 (Google's "Good" zone, median-of-3)
- v4 execute plan brings the homepage into the 100 Club; inner pages are enforced by this site-wide tiered bar.

Every commitment below is a LOAD-BEARING structural decision. Do not "re-add" any of them without understanding the consequences.

### Hero image(s) are R2-only, NOT Sanity
- **URL pattern**: `https://assets.spiritmediapublishing.com/clowning-from-the-heart/hero-*.webp` (plus any other LCP images moved to R2 per this site's hero structure)
- **Why**: same origin as fonts (one TLS handshake), stable URL enables 103 Early Hints, hardcoded URL survives Sanity edits without rebuild
- **To change a hero**: upload a new WebP (matching sizes at matching quality) to the same R2 path. Any Sanity fields for the hero image have been removed from the schema — editors cannot change the hero via the CMS.

### CSS must stay wrapped in @layer base
- `Layout.astro`'s `<style is:inline>` wraps everything in `@layer base` except `@font-face` and `@keyframes`.
- **Why**: unlayered rules beat every `@layer` rule regardless of specificity. Tailwind v4 ships utilities in `@layer utilities`. If critical CSS is unlayered, `.grid-cols-1` overrides external `.lg:grid-cols-4` and grids collapse site-wide.

### ClientRouter is OFF
- No `<ClientRouter />`, no `import { ClientRouter }` in Layout.astro.
- **Why**: static marketing sites don't need SPA nav. Saves ~125ms forced reflow + ~100ms script eval on mobile.
- All page JS uses `DOMContentLoaded` with readyState guard.

### GA loads on first user interaction
- Events: scroll, mousemove, touchstart, keydown, click. 8s fallback timeout.
- **Why**: Lighthouse never interacts, so GA doesn't load in audits. Real users get GA after they engage (post-LCP).

### `<a>` elements on dark backgrounds MUST have an explicit default-state color class
- Base `a { color: var(--color-red|primary) }` rule in `global.css` otherwise applies → brand color on dark bg fails WCAG.
- Any new `<a href="tel:">`, `<a href="mailto:">`, or link in a dark section needs `text-stone-400` / `text-stone-100` / similar. `hover:text-*` doesn't protect the default state.

### `[data-animate]` transitions are transform-only, no opacity
- `global.css`: `transition: transform 0.65s cubic-bezier(...)`. **Do NOT add `opacity` back to the transition.**
- **Why**: Lighthouse captures frames mid-transition; a 0.65s opacity fade catches text at ~50% opacity → 40+ false color-contrast failures. Transform-only gives the same visual slide-in without the a11y artifact.
- If the site doesn't use `data-animate` at all, this commitment is preventive only.

### Early Hints, CSP, X-Robots-Tag in public/_headers
- `X-Robots-Tag: index, follow` overrides CF Pages' default `noindex` on `*.pages.dev`
- CSP allows CF Insights (`static.cloudflareinsights.com` in `script-src`, `cloudflareinsights.com` in `connect-src`) + all origins actually used by this site
- `Link:` headers for 2 critical fonts on `/*` + hero image on `/` → CF Pages promotes to HTTP/2 103 Early Hints

### Images: width/height attrs match urlFor dimensions
- Every below-fold `<img>` has both attrs. Any urlFor resize change must update the attrs in the same commit.
- `sizes` attribute = actual display width in px, NOT `100vw` (the latter forces over-delivery at DPR 2).

### Build pipeline
- `inlineStylesheets: 'auto'` (NOT `'always'`)
- `scripts/async-css.mjs` postbuild rewrites external CSS to `media="print" onload` swap (invoked from `package.json` build script)
- `scripts/100club-verify.mjs` post-build Playwright asserts grids + h-N images + console errors — blocks bad builds
- `/home/deploy/bin/100club-lint.sh` is wired into `lefthook.yml` pre-commit
- No `@playform/inline` / Beasties — incompatible with TW v4 utility-heavy markup
